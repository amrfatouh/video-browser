general flow
  use search bar to get search term from the user
  make a request to youtube api with the search term
  use the received videos to show list of videos
  when a video is clicked, show the video in video player, show title & description

SearchBar
  the component contains text input where user type search term
  on submitting the search term, the term should be passed to the App through a method in props
  the component would receive a method called onSearchSubmit to be invoked and passed the term
  the App component should define this method and should use the term to make a request

requesting
  App component should use axios to send a get request to the url of youtube api specific to search
  the request should contain some parameters specified in the youtube api docs
  we can make an axios custom client holding the base url and some fixed parameters
  we should leave the search term parameter and "/search/" to be specified while using the custom client
  we use the term sent from the SearchBar (using the method passed by App) to make the request
  when the videos are returned, we store them in the state of App component

showing the video list
  make VideoList component
    the component receives a list of videos to be shown
    the component maps each video to a VideoItem component and passes the video details to it
  make VideoItem component
    the component receives a video to be shown
    it extracts the video title & thumbnail url and view the title and thumbnail

showing the video details
  knowing which video is clicked
    when clicking a VideoItem, that item should be passed to App
    define a method in App component that receives a video to be stored in the state
    this method is called onVideoItemClick
    it is passed to VideoList then to VideoItem
    it is invoked when the VideoItem is clicked
  showing the clicked video
    make VideoDetail item that receives a video to be shown
    show the video title & description
    show an iframe of the video

adding loading
  when the search input is submitted, set isLoading property in App state to true
  when the request arrives, set it to false
  if isLoading is true, render "Loading..." text, else don't render anything
